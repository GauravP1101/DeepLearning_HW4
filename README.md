1) Duplicate the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2) Create a folder named `gan-name_images` and add two subfolders inside it: `real` and `fake`.
3) Open the `.ipynb` files for each GAN in Jupyter Notebook and execute them. (Note use Palmetto for faster computing)
4) The generated images will be saved in the `gan-name_images` folder.
